### About Me
<!-- My name is Salomon Kabongo KABENAMUALU. I'm currently a Student at the [African Master in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI), working toward an Msc in Machine Intelligence as sponsored by Facebook and Google. Before joining AMMI, I obtained my Msc in Mathematics from [The University of the Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/) in 2019 in affiliation with the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences ([AIMS South Africa](https://aims.ac.za/)), during which I got introduced to the field of Machine Leaning and worked on investigating propreties of words embeddings under the supervision of Prof. [Etienne Barbard](http://news.nwu.ac.za/experts/etienne-barnard). I also hold a B.S. and honors degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from [Université de Lubumbashi](http://www.unilu.ac.cd/). -->
I am a doctoral candidate in computer science at [Leibniz Universität Hannover (LUH)](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/) and a research assistant at the [AI Future Lab](https://leibniz-ai-lab.de/) of the L3S research center and the [Data Science and Digital Libraries research group](https://www.tib.eu/de/forschung-entwicklung/data-science-digital-libraries) at TIB. My academic background includes an MSc in Mathematics Science from the [The University of the Western Cape](https://www.uwc.ac.za/) in South Africa and an MSc from the [African Master in Machine Intelligence](https://aimsammi.org/) (AMMI) (University of Ghana) sponsored by Google and Facebook through the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://nexteinstein.org/).
